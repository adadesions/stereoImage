Disparity Map OpenCV
One way of dealing with stereo-matching errors is to use various techniques of detecting 
potentially inaccurate disparity values and invalidate them, therefore making 
the disparity map semi-sparse. Several such techniques are already implemented 
in the StereoBM and StereoSGBM algorithms.
