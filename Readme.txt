Stereo Face

Disparity Map OpenCV
One way of dealing with stereo-matching errors is to use various techniques of detecting 
potentially inaccurate disparity values and invalidate them, therefore making 
the disparity map semi-sparse. Several such techniques are already implemented 
in the StereoBM and StereoSGBM algorithms.

Delaunay Triangulation
Given a set of points in a plane, a triangulation refers to the subdivision of the plane 
into triangles, with the points as vertices.
